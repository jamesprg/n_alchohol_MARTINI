With an goal of making our scientific work both reproducible and transparent, this repository is home to supplemental files relating to the paper listed above. In this repo, you will find both analysis code and examples/files used to conduct or research. Futhremore, a brief outline of the methods/steps will be housed here. Along with the scripts present in this repo, all tools used to conduct this work are open source. We hope this repo supports those interested in the study of model membranes by way of molecular dynamics, paticularly using the MARTINI forcefield.
